# Minimal personal website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/60f5465d-0a0c-4288-a2a7-a48eb367bd4e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gatsby-personal/deploys)

### What?

My personal website built using Gatsby, styled with Chakra-UI, and deployed to Netlify.

### Styling

I switched from [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) to [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). Although I love styled-compoenets and how far you can go with them but for a simple site Chakra-UI get the job done.

### Setup

I assume you have gatsby on your computer, if not head over to Gatsby's [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/)

Next clone the repo and then cd into the project directory

```js
 git clone https://github.com/hawyar/gatsby-mdx-personal
  cd gatsby-mdx-personal
```

Now run the following command in the terminal

```bash
gatsby develop
```

That tells Gatsby to create a development enviroment for our project which you can open at
**http://localhost:8000** - for GraphiQL open up **http://localhost:8000/___graphql**
