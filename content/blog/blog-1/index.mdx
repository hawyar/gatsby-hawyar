# The Great - Gatsby Framework

> Keep in mind, you are still in React land, Gatsby is merely an opinionated envrioemnt which

- Node.js (npm or yarn)
- Canvas Account (API key)

### Environment Setup

I assume you have Node.js installed if not make sure you download the latest stable version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). For this project, I will be using yarn - a node package manager similar to npm (which comes with Node.js) but faster. If you prefer working with npm feel free to skip this step.

> Both package managers operate the same however, I personally prefer yarn and it includes emojis so can't complain ðŸŒˆ.

I am going to work in Documents and save all the files in there. Feel free to store yours where works best for you.

In Documents, lets create the a directory for our project.

```bash
cd Documents
mkdir <project-name>
```

I called mine **air-canvas**

Next, move into the newly created directory and initialize a new project. If you want to skip the questions and leave them as default then append -y to the end of the following command

```bash
yarn init
## To skip questions and leave them as default
## yarn init -y
```

To leave the default answer just press Enter else you can specify and change these settings later.

```bash
{
  "name": "air-canvas",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A mashup of Airtable and canvas lms api",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "hawyar",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

It is important to know the entry file to out Node app which in our case is index.js (many prefer to call it server.js). Make sure you specify the entry file correctly.

Add the scripts option in our existing package.json

```bash
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node index"
  }
```

Now package.json should include the following

```bash
{
  "name": "air-canvas",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A mashup of Airtable and canvas lms api",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node index"
  },
  "author": "hawyar",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Head over to your project folder and create a src directory and out entry file index.js which we specified in the package.json

```bash
mkdir src
cd src
touch index.js
```

Let's test index.js to see if it works.

```jsx
console.log("Node is cool")
```

That will create a package.json file that holds our dependencies information which makes it easy to share.

Let's create our back-end server using the [express](https://expressjs.com/) framework to create our API.

First install Gatsby on your computer using the gatsby-cli

```bash
yarn global add gatsby-cli
## npm install -g gatsby-cli
```
